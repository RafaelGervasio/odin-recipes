# odin-recipes
- This project is a website displaying tasty recipes
- It's one of the first websties I build in html
- I think I've improved my html skills, and now feel much more confortable with the language

- It was also the first time I've ever used git while coding, so I learned a lot there as well.

- It's also my first project on github, so that's great.
